Dirdiff is a simple directory change tracker and synchronization tool built for my own specific needs.

Dirdiff allows you to create revisions of files within a directory, which you can then use to track changes across
revisions, as well as syncing changes on remote directories through SSH, while avoiding transferring existing files
that have just been moved.

You should use dirdiff if you find yourself frequently adding and removing files across different directories which need
syncing, while avoiding unecessary deletions. If you instead have a use case where file contents are changed frequently,
instead use rsync.
